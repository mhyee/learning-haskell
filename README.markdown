Learning Haskell
================

This repo will serve to track my attempts at learning [Haskell][h].

I plan on keeping track of all the programs I write while learning Haskell. Additionally, I plan to keep notes, to record useful resources I found or pitfalls I encountered. Hopefully somebody else learning Haskell will find this repo to be useful.

As a starting point, [this Stack Overflow post][so] seems to be quite helpful. I also downloaded the [Haskell platform][hp].

I will be starting off by going through the textbook [Learn You a Haskell][lyah].
