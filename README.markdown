Learning Haskell
================

This repo will serve to track my attempts at learning [Haskell][].

I plan on keeping track of all the programs I write while learning Haskell. Additionally, I plan to keep notes, to record useful resources I found or pitfalls I encountered. Hopefully somebody else learning Haskell will find this repo to be useful.
